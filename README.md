# HangMan-Game
This is a Classic hangman game in which the user has to guess a randomly generated word letter by letter. After every wrong guess one part of the Hangmam is added to the console. You get a total of 6 gusses. Shown in the image below-

As you proceed with the game after two successful letter guesses you get a extra option to guess the entire word at once. If you get the word correct you win the game if not 1 guess is reduced from total guesses.
